        <p>
            My visit was phenomenal! My pastor's daughter is currently a freshman there, and she gave me
            a personal tour and I got to sit in a couple of classes. I spend the night in another student's
            dorm, and then attended Enginieering Preview Day, where I met several of the professors. Every person
            I spoke to their was extremely polite and corteous, and the professors even too up prayer requests
            before starting class (it's a Christian school). The facilities are very nice, and as with every rapidly
            growing school, they have several more building planned. They are also 1 of 20 schools in the nation to
            be recognized as an N.S.A. Center of Excellence in Cyber Operations.
